## What is Go (Golang)

Go is a statically typed, compiled high-level programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is syntactically similar to C, but also has memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language))
